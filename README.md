# Geospatial-Data-Conflation-WebGIS-App
This is one part of my dissertation. The website is a draft and will be improved in near future. 

This is a web GIS app for geospatial data conflation developed by my advisor and I. A closer step to finishing my dissertation.
Front end development referred to react.
Back end development is based on nodeJS.
Will post original codes after my defense.
